A logger in a backend server is used to record and track various events and activities that occur within the application. It helps with debugging by capturing error messages and stack traces, monitors application performance by logging requests and their durations, and provides an audit trail by recording user actions and system events. This ensures better visibility, easier troubleshooting, and improved overall system management.
